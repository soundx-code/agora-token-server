# Node.js GraphQL MongoDB TypeScript Boilerplate

This repository provides a boilerplate codebase for building applications using Node.js, GraphQL, MongoDB, and TypeScript. It's designed to help you kickstart your project and save you time setting up the foundational components.

## Features

- **Node.js**: A server-side runtime for executing JavaScript code.
- **GraphQL**: A powerful query language for your API.
- **MongoDB**: A popular NoSQL database for data storage.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript for enhanced code quality.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
